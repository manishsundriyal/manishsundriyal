### Exponentiation:
Exponentiation is a mathematical operation operates on two numbers (binary operation), one of the number is called base and other one is called exponent or power. It is denoted by $$a^n$$ where $$'a'$$ is base and $$'n'$$ is exponent.

$$a^n = a \times a \times a \times ... n$$ times.

### Regular Approach:
A simple approach to calculate $$a^n$$ is to multiply $$‘a’$$ with itself for $$‘n’$$ times. While implementing it we need to iterate for $$‘n’$$ times and calculate the product $$result \times a$$ in each iteration with result set to value $$1$$ before iterating for the product. Time Complexity for this approach is $$O(n)$$, hence it is not very efficient and takes lot of time when $$‘n’$$ is large.

```javascript
const power = (base, exp) => {
	let result = 1;
	for(let i = 0; i < exp; i++){
		result *= base;
	}
	return result;
}
```
### Fast Exponentiation:
A better approach is to use divide and conquer technique and break down the problem into simpler problem, in this case we can keep breaking this series of product into 2 identical parts till we get the base number itself i,e.
If $$‘n’$$ is even we can break it as:

$$a^n = a \times a \times a \times ... n$$ times

$$a^n = (a \times a \times a \times ... \frac{n}{2}$$ times$$) \times (a \times a \times a \times ... \frac{n}{2}$$ times$$)$$

Here both parts are identical so we don’t need to calculate both parts. If $$‘n’$$ would have been odd we can break it as:

$$a^n = (a \times a \times a \times ... \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor $$ times $$) \times a \times (a \times a \times a \times ... \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$$ times$$)$$

now again we get to identical parts. We don’t have to stop here we will keep breaking it till we get $$(\frac{n}{2^x})=1$$ (base number). This approach is much faster than previous approach and can be implemented using recursion. Its Time Complexity is $$O(log(n))$$.

```javascript
const power = (base, exp) => {
	if (exp === 0){
		return 1;
	}
	if (exp === 1){
		return base;
	}
	const result = power(base, Math.floor(exp / 2)));
	if (exp % 2 === 0){
		return result * result;
	}
    return result * base * result;
}
```
There is another approach binary exponentiation that uses bit manipulation and gives same time complexity as this approach.

### Complexity:
Regular Approach:
- Time Complexity = $$O(n)$$
- Space Complexity = $$O(1)$$

Fast Exponentiation:
- Time Complexity = $$O(\log(n))$$	
- Space Complexity = $$O(\log(n))$$ (Size of Recursion Stack)
